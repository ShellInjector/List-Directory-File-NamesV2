# List-Directory-File-NamesV2 (Completed/Working)
This is a more complex script that creates a list of names for the every files/folder within the directory, this includes sub files/ sub folders, using recursion. Next, the script outputs the list to a text file. The name of the output text file is needed as a parameter. Created and Tested on Windows OS.
<br /><br />
Note: Indent(s) and an arrow will be given to a sub file or folder. As the sub file or folder increase in depth from the main directory, another indent will be added on.<br />
Created and Tested on Windows OS.
